Glint is configured by adding a `"glint"` key to your project's `tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json` file.

{% code title="tsconfig.json" %}

```javascript
{
  "compilerOptions": { /* ... */ },
  "include": [ /* ... */ ],
  "glint": {
    "environment": "ember-loose"
  }
}
```

{% endcode %}

## Configuring Glint

The general shape of the value of the `"glint"` key looks like this:

```typescript
interface GlintConfigInput {
  environment: string | Record<string, unknown>;
  checkStandaloneTemplates?: boolean;
  transform?: {
    include?: string | Array<string>;
    exclude?: string | Array<string>;
  };
}
```

Each key is summarized in further detail below.

### `environment`

The `environment` key specifies what Glint environment(s) your project is operating in. For instance, in loose-mode Ember.js project where you have `@glint/environment-ember-loose` installed, you could specify `"environment": "ember-loose"`.

Some environments may accept user-specified configuration, and some projects may have multiple Glint environments that they're operating in. In either case, you can specify one or more environments with configuration passed to them with an object literal:

```javascript
"glint" {
  "environment": {
    "ember-loose": {},
    "glimmerx": {
      "additionalGlobals": ["my-special-template-macro"]
    }
  }
}
```

### `checkStandaloneTemplates`

In environments like `ember-loose` that support templates in separate files from their backing class, Glint normally determines whether to typecheck a template based on whether its backing class is in a `.ts` or `.js` file. However, for a template-only component, there's no backing module to check.

This flag defaults to `true`, and setting it to `false` means Glint will never produce type errors for templates that don't have a corresponding `.js` or `.ts` file.

### `transform`

This key allows you to opt specific paths in or out of being treated as "template aware" by Glint. By default, all files covered by your `tsconfig.json`/`jsconfig.json` will be transformed by Glint to reflect the contents of any templates they either contain or are associated with.

If you're in the process of migrating a codebase, though, or have an old section you don't intend to make typesafe with Glint, you can use the `include` and/or `exclude` keys to determine which parts of your project Glint will treat as vanilla JS/TS.

Each key may be either a glob or an array of globs, relative to the location of your config file. Specifying `include` stop Glint from transforming _any_ files that don't match the given glob(s), while specifying `exclude` will leave Glint's transformation enabled by default and only disable it for the given globs. If a file is matched by both `include` _and_ `exclude`, it will be excluded.

For example, given this configuration:

```javascript
"glint" {
  "environment": "ember-loose",
  "transform": {
    "include": "app/components/**",
    "exclude": [
      "app/components/not-ready-yet.*",
      "app/components/none-of-these/**"
    ]
  }
}
```

The following paths would have their templates analyzed:

- `app/components/welcome.{ts,hbs}`
- `app/components/some/nested/thing.{ts,hbs}`

While these would not:

- `app/components/not-ready-yet.{ts,hbs}`
- `app/components/none-of-these/deeply/nested.{ts,hbs}`
- `app/templates/application.hbs`
- `tests/integration/components/welcome-test.ts`
