# Glint [![CI](https://github.com/typed-ember/glint/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/typed-ember/glint/actions?query=workflow%3ACI)

TypeScript-powered tooling for Glimmer templates.

## Overview

[Glint] is a set of tools to aid in developing code that uses the Glimmer VM for rendering, such as [Ember.js] and [GlimmerX] projects. Similar to [Vetur] for Vue projects or [Svelte Language Tools], Glint consists of a CLI and a language server to provide feedback and enforce correctness both locally during editing and project-wide in CI.

⚠️ Note: **Glint is still under active development!** Please bear with us and expect breaking changes and rough edges as we work toward a stable release. Also note that Glint is currently only compatible with TypeScript projects, but our aim is ultimately to support JavaScript as well, as TypeScript's tooling can provide best-in-class support for both TS and JS projects.

## Getting Started

Glint is broken into several different packages that you may use, depending on the details of your project. Typically you'll add `@glint/core` and a Glint environment package that reflects the type of project you're working on, then add `"glint"` key to your `tsconfig.json` that tells Glint what it should look at.

For more specific details on setting up Glint in your project, take a look at [the documentation], in particular the Installation pages [for Ember.js projects] and [for GlimmerX projects].

## Using Glint

The `@glint/core` package includes two executables: `glint` and `glint-language-server`.

The `glint` CLI can be used to typecheck your project in a similar manner to `tsc`, but with understanding of how values flow through templates.

You can [use the `glint` executable in CI][using-glint] to ensure you maintain type safety in your templates. You can also use the `glint` command locally with the `--watch` flag to monitor your project as you work!

Similarly, `glint-language-server` can be used by editor integrations to expose that same information inline as you type.

The language server can also enable your editor to provide other richer help, such as type information on hover, automated refactoring, and more. See [the VS Code extension README](packages/vscode) for further examples.
